This directory contains all the source code needed to create the
stand-alone utilites normally found in '/sys'.
Originally, the source code for each utility was contained
in one source file per utility. Most of the utilites remain that way
and much code is duplicated in each of the utilites. Some of the
utilites, because of changes and improvements, reference
a few routines which are found in library 'ulib.a'.
The newer utilities, and eventually all the utilities, are built
from a relatively small source file and from several routines
in 'ulib.a' and 'iolib.a'. The newer utilities also refernece
the '.h' files in this directory.
The '.h' files contain the 'define' statements necessary to
define all the device register offsets, function codes, status
and error code bits, etc. for the various devices.
'ulib.a' contains the object code
for all the non-i/o-related functions common to the
utilities; 'iolib.a' contains the object code for i/o-related
functions common to the utilities.
'iosrc.a' contains the source code for the objects in 'iolib.a'.
'src.a' contains the source for the objects in 'ulib.a'.
